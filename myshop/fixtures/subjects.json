Diese Tradition hat sich die Azul Rösterei zu Nutze gemacht um mit dem Cemorrado einen Filterkaffee zu schaffen, der mit besonders ausgeprägten Mandel- und Haselnussnoten begeistert. Die ausgewählten Bohnen aus der Region Cerrado im Südosten Brasiliens verleihen dem Kaffee außerdem Nuancen von Honig und Milchschokolade.\r\n\r\nAufwendiges Cupping\r\nUm die richtigen Bohnen für diesen Kaffee zu finden, der schließlich den Namen Cemorrado erhielt, war ein intensives Cupping von Nöten. Das Ergebnis in der Tasse ist ein hervorragender Filterkaffee, der sich für jeden Tag und jede Gelegenheit eignet.",
