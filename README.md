## Introduction  
  
"Shop" is an application based on Python using the Django framework. It implements the following  
functionality:  
  
- **Django admin panel** - _where you can add, edit, remove products and categories_  
- **Session based cart** -  _which keeps track of the current relationship with the client and allows you to  
  add and remove items from the cart_  
- **Order processing**  
- **Filter products by a category**

## Installation Guide  
1. Clone git repository:
```  
git clone https://github.com/KirylDumanski/Shop.git  
``` 
2. Install a Virtual Environment.  
  
3. Install the dependencies. 
```  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  
4. [Install Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)

5. [Install the Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/development/quickstart?#setup-cli)

6. Rename `.env.dist` to `.env` and [inject your own credentials](#injecting-your-own-credentials)

7. Make and apply migrations:
```  
python manage.py makemigrations  
python manage.py migrate  
```  
8. Create superuser:
```  
python manage.py createsuperuser  
```


## Injecting your own credentials
### Generate your own Django secret key.
1. Run in terminal following code
```  
manage.py shell  
```  
```  
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key  
```  
```  
get_random_secret_key()  
```  
  
2. Copy the generated key and paste it into `.env`:
```
SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure-<YOUR__OWN_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY>'
```


### Get your own Stripe keys.
1. Head into [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Ftest%2Fapikeys) and grab your API keys (public key and secret key).  
  
2. Copy API keys and paste them into ```.env```:  
```  
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "<YOUR_OWN_PUBLIC_KEY>"  
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "<YOUR_OWN_SECRET_KEY>"  
```  
3. Run the Stripe CLI to login and authenticate your Stripe user Account:  
```  
stripe login  
```  
4. Write in the console:  
```  
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/payments/webhooks/stripe/  
```

5. Then youâ€™ll see the answer, where will be your own webhook secret code. Take that key and paste it into ``.env``:  
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "<YOUR_OWN_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY>"  
```


## Run Guide
1. Start a local web server:
 ```
 python manage.py runserver
 ```
2. Run a Redis Server in a new terminal's window:
```
redis-server
```
3. Run a Celery worker in new terminal's window:
```
celery -A shop worker -l info --without-gossip -P solo
```
4. To receive webhook events from Stripe on your local machine run the following in new terminal's window:
```
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/payments/webhooks/stripe/
```


## Simulate payments to test Stripe integration

To simulate transactions without moving any money you can use special values in test mode.

>Use the card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
> 
>Use any valid future date
> 
>Use any three-digit CVC
>  
>Use any value you like for other form fields
